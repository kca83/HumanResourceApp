a bugz life.

ticket 0- I'd say "type your selection to continue"... "select" makes me think i should be able to click:)

ticket 1- "Update" menu assumes one knows the field names... to update compensation you need to do the
entire set of fields. if you put in an invalid entry, the entire update fails

ticket 2- in the flow of the application (having just entered a ton of stuff)when prompted to update
score, my inclination is to enter a score. needing to key in "Add" first is inconsist.
"Enter phone number: g
Enter email address: g
New employee, g, added with ID: 00000.
Please add resume. Enter [Skip] to add one later.
g
Resume added
Please update employee score. Enter [Add] to do so now or [Skip] to do so later."


ticket 3- employee record return should have field names:
===== ProspectMenu =====
Select option:
[ ADD ] [ UPDATE ] [ CLEAR ] [ HOME ] [ EXIT ]
update
Pick [back] to return to the prospect menu.
Selected:
eeee
ee
ee
ee
ee
ee ee, ee

Employee ID:  00002
Title:
Employment Status:  PROSPECT
Entrance Interview Date:  null
